# AD-User-Management
Various scripts for Active Directory user management.
As always, run scripts at your own risk, ensure you know what a script does before you run it.
I'm not responsible if your Active Directory throws a conniption fit.

Some scripts in this repository were created with very specific processes in mind. Ensure you read the script descriptions before running them.

==============

**New User Creation Script (NUC)**

Simplify the user creation process. Creates an Active Directory account, instructs technician to create mailbox in Exchange, and script awaits attachment of mailbox and automatically adjusts account mail values to meet domain requirements.
